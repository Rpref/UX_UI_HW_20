      <p class="lead-body"><b>People need to trust an organization, or otherwise be familiar with it, in order to donate or get involved; and they get involved through word of mouth from people in their communities.</b></p>
      <p class="lead-body">We determined that we might be able to help if we can make users feel a more personal connection to the people involved in Ben's Bells, as well as understand the direct impact of their contributions.</p>
      <p class="lead-body">We might do this by prominently showcasing the founder and her story, displaying more photos of volunteers, making the Kindness Calendar interactive, and providing clarity on where donation funds are allocated.</p>
